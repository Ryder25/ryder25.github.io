title: "Dirt 4 and Discord"
---
I've been getting a lot of questions about Dirt 4's nefs files recently.  At this point I have no plans to create a new application for this file type.  I don't have as much time, as in the past, to work on new stuff.  I may eventually get to it, but don't hold your breath.

On a side note, I have created a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5bCjMqS) for Ego Engine game modding.  I encourage everyone to join in on discussions with fellow modders.  It'd be a great way for the community to help each other out.
