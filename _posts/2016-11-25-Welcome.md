Welcome to yet another version of this website.  This time I've dropped Wordpress, and have decided to go with Jekyll.  I mostly decided to make the switch for the sake of learning Jekyll. Also, Wordpress has way more functionality than I ever needed to use.

Anyway, even as the website changes over time, I expect to keep this domain name for as long as I can.  I ask that whenever you link to any of the software, you link directly to this page. (ryder25.com) This website will always point to the latest download location of the software.

Finally, please do not redistribute the software.  If for some reason you have trouble accessing a download feel free to contact me directly, and I will make accomodations.

All software is free, and donations are optional. Thanks for reading and have fun!
